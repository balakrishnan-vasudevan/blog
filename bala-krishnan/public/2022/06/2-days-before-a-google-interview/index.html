				<p>I am interviewing for the Systems SRE role with Google (Alphabet) in about 2 days. The SRE team at Google is something that I have looked up to ever since I read the first SRE book. I have tried interviewing for the role twice previously and I wasn&rsquo;t able to go past the phone screen both the times. Hoping that the third time will be the charm!</p>
<p>Google pioneered the concept of Site Reliability Engineering, which is an amalgamation of systems engineering, coding and scripting, and networking functions. Google has two kinds of SREs - systems SREs, who have more expertise in the Unix/Linux systems and troubleshooting domain and software SREs who have more expertise with coding. The interviews for this role are also unique.</p>
<p>My recruiter felt that I would be a better fit for the Systems SRE role and I also had an opportunity to talk to a member of the SRE team prior to my phone screen. Google calls this the &ldquo;champion call&rdquo; and it was really useful. The person I spoke to was able to explain to me what interviewers look for in the responses a candidate gives and also discussed his journey with the SRE team. Python is my choice of the coding/scripting language and I will be using it for all the coding interviews.</p>
<p>The interviews consist of a phone screen which would involve a practical coding problem and some Linux trivia. Upon  clearing this round, a candidate would advance to the onsite interview which would have a couple of rounds involving coding, Linux internals, Networking, Non-abstract Large Scale Systems Design (NALSD - this round is unique to Google), and a behavioral round. Once a candiate clears the onsite interview, they would progress to multiple interviews with prospective teams to help the candidate decide which team they would best fit.</p>
<p>I am hoping to document my journey properly this time and what better way to do it than my own blog! I cannot disclose any of the questions that will be asked, but I would like to share my experience.</p>
<p>This is what I am preparing for my first round of the Google Systems SRE interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brushing up on Python&rsquo;s memory management, particular emphasis on Garbage Collection and support for multithreading.</li>
<li>Python&rsquo;s data structures - the inbuilt Lists, Dictionary, Tuple and Set and the deque, bisect, defaultdict, Counter, OrderedDict, heapq datastructures.</li>
<li>File operations using Python</li>
<li>Linux system internals - basic system calls, port numbers etc.</li>
<li>Linux boot process.</li>
<li>Linux process management - what happens when you type a command?</li>
<li>What happens when you enter a website on your browser and press enter? - The entire sequence of steps.</li>
</ul>
