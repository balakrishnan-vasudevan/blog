I set goals for how I want to grow my technical skills every year that I have been employed and fall short. 2021 was a similar year too. I set goals and fell short, by more than a mile. 

So, what did I plan to learn this year? I wanted to get better with my Kubernetes knowledge and clear the CKA certification. How did I fare? I did learn a lot about Kubernetes as part of my job and my oncall duties, but I was not able to take the certification and had to cancel the registration for the exam.
Now to the books. I got multiple book recommendations from tech Twitter and got most of them. I haven't gotten around to reading any of them fully. This is what having a TV in the bedroom would do to you!
These are the books that I have in either paper form or on Kindle or PDF that I have been meaning to read, but did not go through with. My plan is to complete them before the end of 2022.

* System Desgin Interview by Alex Xu
* Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
* Networking and Kubernetes by James Strong and Vallery Lancey
* Building Secure and Reliable Systems

Trainings/Video Courses:
* A regex course on Udemy
* Terraform courses on Pluralsight
* A couple of AWS architecture courses on the AWS Partner Network.

Let's see if I can finish them by 2022!
